		<h1>YOU SHOULD KNOW:</h1>
		<p>'A joy shared, is a joy doubled. A sorrow shared, is a sorrow halved.'</p>
		<p>   Nobody in this world is perfect. But nobody is worthless either. Being unique is actually a blessing. Do not try to be someone else, just because you have a few inabilities of your own. Always try to be THE BETTER YOU! </p>
		<p>   If you have a very big secret, of yourself or of others, or any insecurities, thoughts, or nightmares, that you cannot share with anyone, and it is driving you crazy, then you have come to the right place!</p>
